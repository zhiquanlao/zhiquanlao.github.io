I am a senior undergraduate majoring in [physics](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics) and [mathematics](https://lsa.umich.edu/math) at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). My research interest includes holography, black hole, quantum information, and machine learning.

I am currently supervised by Professor Finn Larsen, working on superradiance instability of Kerr-Newman-AdS black hole, and have done a literature review on the information paradox. I was supervised by Professor Junjie Zhu to develop TDC ASIC for ATLAS in junior year, and was supervised by Professor Kwok Yee Wong to study highway traffic using machine learning in sophomore year.
